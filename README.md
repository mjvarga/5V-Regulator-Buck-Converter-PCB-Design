# 5V-Regulator-Buck-Converter-PCB-Design

This project demonstrates the design of a switching regulator (buck converter) suitable for powering microcontrollers, servos, and embedded systems.

The main utilization of this PCB is to ensure that the output voltage is 5V.

A basic and simple project, but one of my first.

# What?
- The idea was to design a reliable 5V regulator circuit to power microcontrollers and other low-voltage electronics from higher input voltages.
# How?
- Implemented a design using the LM7805 regulator, capacitors, and a Schottky diode for reverse polarity protection.
- Added bulk capacitors to smooth sudden current draws and ceramic capacitors to filter high-frequency noise.
- Optimized PCB layout in Altium to ensure stable performance.
# Results
- Produced a PCB design that could theoretically deliver a stable 5V regulated output if fabricated.
- Improved robustness against voltage spikes and supply interruptions.
- Strengthened understanding of power regulation, decoupling strategies, and PCB layout for noise reduction.
