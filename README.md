# 5V-Regulator-Buck-Converter-PCB-Design

This project demonstrates the design of a switching regulator (buck converter) suitable for powering microcontrollers, servos, and embedded systems.

The main utilization of this PCB is to ensure that the output voltage is 5V.

A basic and simple design, but one of my first.
